# 数列 Sequences
数列是按照一定顺序排列的一列数，通常根据某种规则或公式确定各项。
数列在数学中具有重要意义，是研究数值模式、递推关系和极限的重要工具。

A sequence is an ordered list of numbers, usually determined by a specific rule or formula. 
Sequences are significant in mathematics, helping to study numerical patterns, recurrence relations, and limits.

### 3. 数列的性质 Properties of Sequences
递增数列 (Increasing Sequence): 如果数列中的每一项都比前一项大，则称为递增数列。 
Increasing Sequence: A sequence is increasing if each term is greater than the previous term.

递减数列 (Decreasing Sequence): 如果数列中的每一项都比前一项小，则称为递减数列。 
Decreasing Sequence: A sequence is decreasing if each term is less than the previous term.

有界数列 (Bounded Sequence): 如果数列中的所有项都被某一特定值限制，则称为有界数列。 
Bounded Sequence: A sequence is bounded if all its terms are confined within some specific value.
