### Set Theory (集合理论)

**Set Theory** is one of the foundational areas of mathematics that deals with the concept of sets, which are collections of objects or elements.<br/> In both pure and applied mathematics, sets are fundamental building blocks used to define other mathematical structures.<br/> The study of set theory is vital because it forms the foundation for much of modern mathematics, from algebra to topology.

### 1. **Basic Definitions (基本定义)**

- **Set (集合)**: A set is a well-defined collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right.<br/> The elements of a set are the objects contained within it. For example, the set of natural numbers less than 5 is:  
  \( A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \).

- **Element (元素)**: An element is an individual object in a set. For example, 3 is an element of the set \( A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \), written as \( 3 \in A \).

- **Set Builder Notation (集合描述法)**: A set can be described by a property or condition that its elements satisfy. For example, the set of all natural numbers less than 5 can be written as:  
  \( A = \{ x \mid x \in \mathbb{N}, x < 5 \} \), which reads as "A is the set of all x such that x is a natural number and x is less than 5."

### 2. **Types of Sets (集合的类型)**

- **Finite Set (有限集合)**: A set with a finite number of elements. For example, \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \) is a finite set.

- **Infinite Set (无限集合)**: A set with infinitely many elements. For example, the set of natural numbers \( \mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \dots\} \) is an infinite set.

- **Subset (子集)**: A set \( B \) is a subset of set \( A \), written \( B \subseteq A \), if every element of \( B \) is also an element of \( A \).

- **Proper Subset (真子集)**: A set \( B \) is a proper subset of set \( A \), written \( B \subset A \), if every element of \( B \) is an element of \( A \) and \( B \neq A \).

- **Universal Set (全集)**: The set that contains all elements under consideration, typically denoted by \( U \). All other sets are subsets of the universal set.

- **Empty Set (空集)**: The set that contains no elements, denoted by \( \emptyset \) or \( \{\} \).

### 3. **Set Operations (集合运算)**

- **Union (并集)**: The union of two sets \( A \) and \( B \) is the set of all elements that are in \( A \), in \( B \), or in both. Denoted \( A \cup B \).  
  Example: If \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \) and \( B = \{3, 4, 5\} \), then \( A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \).

- **Intersection (交集)**: The intersection of two sets \( A \) and \( B \) is the set of all elements that are in both \( A \) and \( B \). Denoted \( A \cap B \).  
  Example: If \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \) and \( B = \{3, 4, 5\} \), then \( A \cap B = \{3\} \).

- **Difference (差集)**: The difference between two sets \( A \) and \( B \) is the set of all elements that are in \( A \) but not in \( B \). Denoted \( A - B \).  
  Example: If \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \) and \( B = \{3, 4, 5\} \), then \( A - B = \{1, 2\} \).

- **Complement (补集)**: The complement of a set \( A \) is the set of all elements not in \( A \), relative to the universal set \( U \). Denoted \( A' \) or \( \overline{A} \).

### 4. **Venn Diagrams (维恩图)**

A Venn diagram is a visual tool used to represent sets and their relationships. Circles represent sets, and the areas inside and outside the circles represent different combinations of set membership.

- **Union (并集)**: The union of sets is represented by shading the areas inside both circles.
- **Intersection (交集)**: The intersection of sets is represented by shading the area where the circles overlap.
- **Difference (差集)**: The difference is represented by shading the area of one circle but not the other.
- **Complement (补集)**: The complement is represented by shading everything outside of the circle representing the set.

### 5. **Power Set (幂集)**

The power set of a set \( A \), denoted \( \mathcal{P}(A) \), is the set of all subsets of \( A \), including the empty set and \( A \) itself. If \( A \) has \( n \) elements, then \( \mathcal{P}(A) \) has \( 2^n \) elements.

For example, if \( A = \{1, 2\} \), then the power set is:  
\( \mathcal{P}(A) = \{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{1, 2\}\} \).

### 6. **Cartesian Product (笛卡尔积)**

The Cartesian product of two sets \( A \) and \( B \), denoted \( A \times B \), is the set of all ordered pairs \( (a, b) \) where \( a \in A \) and \( b \in B \).  
Example: If \( A = \{1, 2\} \) and \( B = \{a, b\} \), then \( A \times B = \{(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b)\} \).

### 7. **Important Properties (重要性质)**

- **Idempotent Law (幂等律)**: \( A \cup A = A \), \( A \cap A = A \)
- **Commutative Law (交换律)**: \( A \cup B = B \cup A \), \( A \cap B = B \cap A \)
- **Associative Law (结合律)**: \( A \cup (B \cup C) = (A \cup B) \cup C \), \( A \cap (B \cap C) = (A \cap B) \cap C \)
- **Distributive Law (分配律)**: \( A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C) \), \( A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \)

### Conclusion (总结)

Set theory is essential for understanding almost all areas of mathematics. Its concepts provide a way to describe and manipulate collections of objects, and they underpin more complex topics such as number theory, geometry, and topology. Mastering set theory is critical for anyone pursuing higher mathematics.
